        <p>WeatherApp was inspired by both societal and practical needs.
          As it is a very important part of our daily lives, WeatherApp is
          vital to help plan our daily activities. A lot of people do not use weather apps because
          they find them either boring or difficult to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          WeatherApp was inspired to help meet these needs and even provide more.
        </p>
        <p>
          A six-week duration was used to build the WeatherApp. Each week,
          a part of the app was carefully built and sent to peers for review.
